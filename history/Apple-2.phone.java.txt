With HM, started off with general question on background, inteerests and match with the team. Then went into bit technical 10mins into call. Main things covered. 
1. Asked about what new features I liked in Java8 and why. 
2. When would I use CompletableFutures - advantages, what applications would use them the best.
3. How would I go about immplementing a HashMap - make it concurrent. How ConcurrentHashMaps work - internal details.
4. What is more important for the team (service performance - latency most important).
5. Frameworks I have used if any.
6. Some memory model stuff, don't remember exactly.
