# Practice
Personal repo of solutions to interview questions I solve. Solutions would be organized according to the source.

# Sources
* Leetcode
* Geeksforgeeks
* Project Euler
* Glassdoor

# Testing
Note that solutions might not have unit-tests associated with them(esp Leetcode), but are validated with test-cases on leetcode test runner. Unit-tests for solutions that are validated on leetcode are ignored in interest of time.
