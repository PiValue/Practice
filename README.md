# Practice
Personal repo of solutions to interview questions I solve. Solutions would be organized according to the source.

# Sources
* Leetcode
* Geeksforgeeks
* Project Euler
* Glassdoor

# Testing
Note that solutions might not have unit-tests associated with them(esp Leetcode), but are validated with test-cases on leetcode test runner. Unit-tests for solutions that are validated on leetcode are ignored in interest of time.

#Index
Index to solutions with some explanation for easy lookup.

##Generate list of all valid parenthesis of given length
Given a value "n" - generate all possible valid parenthesis string of length "n". Example below,

n = 4 should generate `["()()", "(())"]`
n = 6 should generate `["((()))", "(())()"]`
